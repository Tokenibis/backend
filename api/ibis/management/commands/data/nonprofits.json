There are homeless children and youth attending kindergarten through 12th grades. High-risk students have the most to gain from after-school and summer programs in terms of educational opportunity--encouraging and tracking participation across the year helps youth stay engaged (Harvard Research, 2011). Creating structured environments for at-risk students to improve their literacy skills, receive enrichment activities and learn about careers provides students with additional support to be successful in school. After-school and summer programs also allow students to strengthen their social skills and friendships with peers. This enhances their support system at school. Improving academic outcomes for these students is important for educators and policymakers./n/nThe Homeless Project's after-school tutoring and summer programs will provide academic, enrichment and career development activities for approximately 335 students (185 during the school year, 150 during the summer) homeless students during 2018-2019.

The population ABQ Reads works with is considered 'vulnerable' primarily due to the effects of poverty. The most recent data shows that two-thirds of ABQ Reads students come from poverty backgrounds. The program serves in three, public elementary schools, which are all Title I schools and, are are further qualified under the Community Eligible Provision which is applied to schools with very high poverty levels.\u00a0\u00a0 The majority of the students served by the program are minorities./n/nEvidence of the community's need for early support and intervention literacy services is reflected in the fact that nearly half of New Mexico's adult population is considered functionally illiterate. This severely hampers their ability to secure well-paying jobs that can support themselves and their families. This problem is best addressed early in the education process before issues become permanent.\u00a0 The need becomes more apparent when beginning-of-year literacy scores are evaluated. These scores show that there are significantly more students starting the year at the lowest reading level and significantly less students reading at the highest level when compared to other district schools./n/nABQ Reads' unique method is evident in a few ways. ABQ Reads is the only program in the state to provide individual tutoring during the school day and in conjunction with classroom learning. It is also offered at no charge to every enrolled kindergarten student. The tutoring sessions take place three times per week for thirty minutes each. A volunteer tutor is paired with a student so that every child receives ninety minutes of individualized attention.\u00a0 It is also unique in that it has developed its own curriculum. The curriculum can be tailored by each site coordinator to follow exactly what has been taught in the classroom. It has easy-to-use examples and prompts for the volunteer tutors so that they and the children get the most out of each session. Another unique aspect is the allowance for individual differences and varying academic levels of the students. Because of the one-to-one nature of the program, every session can meet the students' needs and help them continue to progress upward.\u00a0 Regardless of the level of any student, the program meets them where they are, and they do experience success./n/nThe impact to the community is immediate and long-term. The immediate impact can be seen in that these at-risk youth are given access to an academic foundation-building program. A strong academic foundation, especially in the area of literacy, is essential for all future learning and provides an immediate return on investment as children benefiting from the program show more gains and are better prepared for first grade. The long-term impact is seen in that students who experience successes early in their schooling have an increased likelihood of graduating from high school, pursuing higher learning, and transitioning smoothly into productive adulthood."}, {"name": "Share Your Care", "description": "Alivio is an internal funding stream that provides Adult Day Services for low- income, under/uninsured frail, elderly, disabled, and vulnerable adults and seniors in need of services but who do not qualify for funding and can't afford to pay for services privately.

Currently, 300 students are enrolled in grades 9-12. Of these, 60% are minorities, 24% have special education needs (9% higher than the Albuquerque District average), and over 55% qualify for Free or Reduced Lunch (meaning they are low-or moderate-income). Many parents choose ABHS because of a reputation for excellence, as well as the mission to serve. More than 140 community partners have hosted students, including museums, health service providers, and animal rescue agencies. These agencies often serve vulnerable populations themselves and they benefit from ABHS student involvement. Agencies form long-term relationships with students; over 50% of ABHS graduates continue to volunteer, extending their community impact for years beyond high school./n/nNEED: Many ABHS students face risk factors that increase the likelihood of dropping out of high school (e.g., low-income, entering school behind grade level, special needs). Further, they may enter high school without the familial supports that help them succeed and understand the importance of college. Local nonprofits often struggle with limited budgets and variable volunteer capacity; our students fill a need for well-informed and committed volunteers. Through their contributions to the community, ABHS students support greater capacity in local nonprofits that serve thousands of high-need clients. ABHS student volunteering, therefore, benefits central New Mexico widely./n/nMETHOD OF SERVICE PROVISION: ABHS service programming is well-established and ongoing, supported by teachers, advisors, and nonprofit partners. The experience begins in 9th-10th grades with all-school service days (students select partners) and intensifies in 11th grade with a Compass class (students identify talents/interests and develop an aligning project). They then foster the connections they need to carry out their projects. In 12th grade, students execute their projects overseen by nonprofit mentors and ABHS staff and executed at partner nonprofit sites. Through Advisories, students meet in groups throughout their time in high school to discuss service experiences and link them to larger lessons about themselves and their academic and career trajectories. Seniors are required to participate in college preparatory work and pass college courses relevant to their service project. ABHS staff is responsible for ensuring that students are on track with coursework and service commitments, that they have adequate oversight, and that nonprofit partners receive the support they need./n/nIMPACT: Each year, ABHS students commit over 10,000 service hours to nonprofits around the Albuquerque area, expanding capacity to serve clients at cash-strapped nonprofits and lending the insights and energy of students. Further, ABHS has worked with other area schools to train them in service methods to expand the postive impact beyond ABHS students./n/nOur approach is even more important for the students themselves. For those who enter high school without strong support systems and/or who struggle academically, the service focus is empowering. Students find that they can have a direct impact on the lives of others, energizing them to do more and stay in school. Our approach enhances teen\u2019s social intelligence through gaining knowledge about local needs and making community connections, as well as improving emotional intelligence by identifying and working with vulnerable populations while they analyze the impact of their service on themselves./n/nFor years, ABHS has earned an \u2018A\u2019 on the state report card for College and Career Readiness, signaling a strong ability to prepare students for college/careers."}, {"name": "APS Education Foundation-Community Clothing Bank", "description": "Vulnerable Population Served:/n/nThe APS Community Clothing Bank serves the members of our community who are most vulnerable: children living in poverty. In Albuquerque Public Schools, nearly 69% of children qualify for free or reduced price lunch, or over 57,500 students. To put this in context, a family of three qualifying for free lunch makes less than $26,000 a year. Imagine being a parent with just over $2,000 a month to pay for rent, utilities, transportation, food and clothes. It is clear that for many, the math just does not add up. The APS Community Clothing Bank exists to ensure that no child has to miss school due to the lack of clothes or shoes./n/nCommunity Need for Program:/n/nJust like food banks, clothing banks are organized to meet a basic need of Albuquerque\u2019s children. Over the past decade, Albuquerque has seen increasing rates of poverty and higher demand for Clothing Bank services. Starting in 2013, new partnerships with Goodwill Industries of New Mexico and Payless Shoe Source allowed the APS Community Clothing Bank to increase the number of students being served from hundreds to thousands. In 2016-2017, the Clothing Bank served 2,775 students, a new record. In 2017-2018, the Clothing Bank had already served over 2,200 by mid-year./n/nMethod of Service Provision:/n/nStudents needing help with clothing are identified in a number of ways. Sometimes, teachers notice students coming to school without a winter coat or with ragged shoes. Sometimes, parents and older students request help with clothes directly. And sometimes, attendance officers discover the real reason students aren\u2019t coming to school is that they are embarrassed by their clothes. When this happens, a school liaison fills out an online request form. Within seven days, the Clothing Bank delivers a package with 6 pairs of new socks, 6 pairs of underwear, a hoody or light jacket, clothing vouchers for three outfits at Goodwill Industries of New Mexico and if needed, a voucher for a new pair of shoes from Payless Shoe Source.\u00a0 In total students are eligible for up to three Goodwill clothing vouchers (or 9 outfits), two sets of new socks and underwear, and one shoe card per school year./n/nThanks to a partnership with Goodwill Industries of New Mexico, the clothing vouchers are provided free of cost. Goodwill stores are open evenings and weekends and are located near bus lines throughout the city, which takes advantage of existing distribution networks and saves thousands of dollars annually. Similarly, shoe vouchers, while not free, are very cost effective and allow students the dignity of choosing their own shoes.\u00a0/n/nThe APS Community Clothing Bank also partners with the Assistance League\u2019s Operation School Bell, which focuses on providing shoes and uniforms at the thirty-five (35) APS Title I elementary schools and middle schools at which uniforms are required. If a student at a uniform school needs shoes or clothes, he or she is referred to the Assistance League and not the APS Community Clothing Bank. The thousands of students served by the APS Community Clothing Bank each year are in addition to the thousands served by the Assistance League and the organizations work hard to ensure they are never duplicating each other\u2019s work./n/nImpact of the Program:/n/nChronic absenteeism is one of the strongest predictors of school failure researchers have seen. Students who miss more than two days of school a month, or about 10% of the year, are more likely not to read on grade level. Many times, chronic absenteeism is related to a lack of appropriate school clothing. If a child doesn\u2019t have a warm winter coat on a cold day, he or she most likely won\u2019t show up at school. A teenager embarrassed about wearing yesterday\u2019s dirty clothes or last year\u2019s too-small shoes faces just one more barrier to overcome.

The Center on Family Homelessness ranked New Mexico 44th among all states in child homelessness in 2014. Albuquerque Public Schools Title I project estimates 800\u20131,000 children under the age of six were homeless in the Albuquerque metro area in 2016. The primary factors contributing to family homelessness are poverty, lack of affordable housing, and domestic violence. CLNKids\u2019 parents are single-mothers under 30 years old, who lack high school diplomas or GEDs, and are predominantly minorities (Hispanic and Native American). Many are fleeing domestic violence. They are forced to raise their children in vulnerable, at-risk environments, including homeless shelters, cheap motels, and the street. Some even live in their cars with their children. Many of CLNKids\u2019 children are socially and developmentally disadvantaged. Homeless children experience three times the rate of emotional and behavioral problems compared to non-homeless children; are four times more likely to show delayed development; and have twice the rate of learning disabilities as non-homeless children. They also experience high rates of chronic and acute health problems while homeless. Through parent reporting CLNKids has learned that 75% of children in our program have observed and/or experienced family violence. CLNKids preschool uses a high quality, trauma-informed, strengths-based curriculum to meet the special needs of the vulnerable children in our program. We provide developmentally appropriate instruction in Kindergarten readiness skills that include literacy to bridge language gaps, STEM, and handwriting. Our Reggio Emilia approach-inspired curriculum and environment engages children based on their interests through extended provocations and hands-on exploration. Students, teachers and parents travel to Explora monthly to engage in a multitude of STEM hands-on activities. We partner with the Nature Center to hold two, eight-week sessions that immerse children in the natural world. We also conduct regular field trips to local sites (Bio Park, Zoo, Botanical Gardens, etc.). Essential is providing health and wellness activities and ongoing development screenings (physical, dental, socio-emotional, language and intellectual delays) that ensure readiness for success in Kindergarten. Children have access to mental health and therapeutic services, art therapy and play therapy to address socio-emotional needs, a wellness coordinator, and the KidFit program, in which instructors work one-on-one with children around physical fitness activities emphasizing strength, coordination and endurance. The physical activities we plan for children are designed to enhance and support our trauma-informed curriculum. Our wellness coordinator builds on the KidFit physical activities and incorporates these activities into the teachers\u2019 lesson plans so that appropriate, daily exercise activities are included. Children play in a developmentally appropriate outdoor playground that is fully enclosed. Healthy nutrition is an important part of our preschool program. Children are served a hot breakfast, hot lunch, and a snack every day they attend school, and are sent home on weekends with a backpack filled with food. CLNKids strives to place our most educated teachers in the preschool classroom. Given that many children come to our program significantly behind academically, having highly educated and trained teachers offers these children the best chance for success in Kindergarten. Our preschool has a low student-teacher ratio at 1:8 that allows for individual attention to help children catch up quickly.

Here\u2019s how it works: Children\u2019s Choice leadership team surveys all enrolled students, parents, and teachers at each of our 13 school sites, including 6 Title 1 schools\u00a0 (at least 50% of enrolled students qualify for free/reduced lunch) and 3 moderate income schools (between 40-50% of enrolled students qualify for free/reduced lunch) to determine what classes and subjects are most needed.\u00a0 We then meet with school administration to identify the students who are most in need of additional services (Need could be determined by a family\u2019s financial situation, children who are chronically truant, etc) and enroll them first. Then registration opens to all families. The kinds of classes offered include: STEM, the arts, service learning, health and fitness, and cognitive skills. These are classes that are meant to help students try out different and exciting subjects to find the thing that makes them excited to learn and excited to go to school. The need for this program is great- we currently offer 119 classes with low student to teacher ratio./n/nImpact/n/nThe impact of this program is far reaching. Specific measures of success are listed elsewhere but Find Your Spark classes give over 1500 students access to free, high quality afterschool care while improving their engagement and performance in school. This gives parents the peace of mind knowing that their students are safe and engaged during the afterschool hours. This program means that enriching activities are not solely accessible to families that have the means to pay for them. Find Your Spark democratizes opportunity for our students./n/nFunding from the United Way will go exclusively to support Find Your Spark classes at Title 1 schools./n/nWhy Us/n/nChildren\u2019s Choice is uniquely qualified to administer the Find Your Spark program. Ranked as one of the top workplaces and the only 5-star rated after-school provider in Albuquerque (for our Core Program- more traditional tuition-based afterschool care), we have the experience and expertise to make these classes a success. While the Find Your Spark classes are plentiful, quantity must be matched by quality.\u00a0 Thus, classes are taught by professionals in their field and classroom teachers.

The program supports the interns as they develop workforce skills, receive college and career mentoring, explore the principles of experiential learning, provide community service, and serve as near-peer mentors for up to 5,000 elementary school children annually via Explora\u2019s STEM educational programs. Interns spend their sophomore year training on basic job skills and experiential learning, junior year in intense program-facilitation training, and senior year providing educational programs at Explora and in the community.

The Youth Intern Program helps break the cycle by targeting students at two critical levels \u2014 high school and elementary school \u2014 to build interest, confidence, value, and understanding of STEM fields via experiential education programs. It contributes to the development of a stronger workforce by cultivating critical job skills for the interns, including effective communication, time management, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing, and team collaboration, as well as teaching them how to balance school and work to succeed in both. Many of the interns will be the first in their families to pursue higher education and will need to work during college to support their families as they work to build their futures; the Youth Intern Program prepares them to do so./n/nThe target population for Explora\u2019s Youth Intern Program is low-income high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors who desire opportunities for practical workforce training and meaningful community engagement.

Said another way, \u201cyour zip code is a better predictor of your health than your genetic code.\u201d/n/nA medical-legal partnership aims to transform clinic practice by treating both medical and social issues affecting patients\u2019 well-being. Attorneys train medical staff how to identify patients\u2019 legal needs that are adversely affecting their health. Doctors then make referrals to the legal aid attorney on site as they would make a referral for physical therapy or other special service. The attorney then treats those needs through a variety of legal interventions and reports the outcomes back for the patient\u2019s record. The mnemonic I-HELP explains the range of issues MLP attorneys help with: I = Income & Insurance; H=Housing & Utilities; E=Education & Employment; L=Legal Status; P=Personal & Family Stability./n/nThe project began November 2016. In the initial months, a memorandum of understanding between NMLA and FNCH was drafted, AmeriCorps legal fellows were trained, medical staff were trained to identify legal problems, and protocols for referral and services were developed. The first AmeriCorps legal fellow hired was not able to complete her commitment for personal reasons; legal fellow Katy Almond was recruited and began providing services in August 2017. Katy is supervised by the Director of NMLA\u2019s Native American Program, Attorney Cindy Aragon. Katy is on site at FNCH doing new client intake one day a week and additionally as needed, and handles court appearances and completes case work from NMLA\u2019s Santa Ana office in the rest of her fulltime schedule. A licensed attorney, Katy gathers documents and background information from clients, does legal research, provides counsel and advice to clients, assists them with self-help legal documents they can file on their own, and represents clients in administrative hearings and court hearings as needed. Katy and Cindy do project outreach to cooperating entities like the City of Albuquerque Commission on Indian Affairs, the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court\u2019s Healing to Wellness Program and Veterans' Court Program, and state agencies like NM Children, Youth & Families Dept./n/nThe project provides the community with a positive return on investment. Impact is demonstrated in improved patient well-being; increased training of health providers on social determinants and legal solutions; and health system cost savings as people\u2019s needs are met through lower level prevention.

Most students attending the program utilizing a full scholarship that includes a parent volunteer requirement. Our fall/winter program that culminates in activities surrounding the NM Black History Festival in February is offered free of charge. All in all, we spend more than 400 hours with students over the course of a year. In 2013, NMBHOC launched The Roots Summer Leadership Academy, a comprehensive program which integrates an art-based curriculum with a unique counseling component under the direction of Dr. Stephanie McIver, Director of the UNM Student Health and Counseling Center. Arts curriculum can provide a particularly powerful tool to engage youth and spark their curiosity and commitment; enhance thinking and problem solving skills; set high standards of quality, success, and achievement. Each Roots program is inter-related and provides opportunities for students to make sustained and long term tangible contributions to the group and the community and be recognized for those contributions; promote constructive peer and mentor relations through teamwork, decision-making, and critique sessions. The Academy introduces students to skills necessary to participate in other Roots programming. Also, the Theater Apprenticeship facet specifically creates a working environment featuring clear roles and responsibilities; and allow risk-taking in a safe and supportive environment. YouthARTS, a well-established arts program knowledge base, has been conducting programs and collecting best practices of arts programs designed for at-risk populations since 1995. As a result they have decisively determined that arts programs enhance young peoples' attitudes about themselves and their futures and can increase academic achievement and decrease delinquent behavior. Self-esteem, a main tenant of Roots programming, is a critical component of student success academically as well as having significant impact on interpersonal relationships and behavior. The therapeutic counseling component, based on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem assessment, contributes to the programs ability to do what the National Education Associated calls contextualization, i.e., connect teaching and curriculum to the experiences, values, knowledge, and needs of students. The Roots programs address needs identified at the National level, as well as those we have identified at the local community level. With curriculum designed to address issues of effort/motivation, specifically creates opportunities for students to identify areas of weakness and strength, assisting students with the development of journaling and creating strategies for achievement of success across a broad spectrum of goals. Incorporating cultural history and education throughout its programming, The Roots Academy is closing this gap and working to widen its ability to have a greater impact on underserved low-moderate income students in New Mexico. The American Institutes for Research published a paper in 1994 by Barbara T. Bowman, which clearly articulates an existing educational gap here in New Mexico. \u201cBy ignoring the differences between children - their experiences, their beliefs, their traditional practices - schools limit their own ability to educate these children.\u201d The Roots Academy holistic curriculum is designed to help students fully actualize their individual potential, to greater increase their contributions to the community overall."}, {"name": "Domestic Violence Resource Center (DVRC)", "description": "DVRC empowers victims and engages the community to break the cycle of domestic violence (DV).

In 2017, ASLHC dispensed 106 hearing aids and repaired/maintained 404 hearing aids for New Mexico Medicaid beneficiaries.
