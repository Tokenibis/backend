***Welcome:Welcome to Token Ibis***

Hello {user}, you wonderfully thoughtful and warm-hearted human!

Just by creating a profile on our app, you have taken your first big step in democratizing social impact.

... What exactly does that mean?

Glad you asked! As you have seen, Token Ibis functions similarly to cash apps. It provides a platform in which charitable giving is easily accessible and transferrable. You can effortlessly deposit and transfer money in our app, which can then be donated to any of the registered nonprofits listed on our Donate page. By using this app, you are empowered to be informed about:

a) Where your money goes
b) What your money supports
c) Other ventures you can share or support.

Additionally, Token Ibis stands as an app through which you can interact and share. You can deposit your own money to donate to one or many of your favorite nonprofits, or to transfer to others so they can donate to theirs. You can also follow activities and pages of the nonprofits you support, as well as be notified of any upcoming events or opportunities to get involved. Token Ibis will alert you of any activity that involves you or your account, such as:

a) Verifying your deposits in the app*
b) Announcing a weekly gift or transaction to your account
c) Notifications detailing when someone follows or comments on your transaction, donation, or post.

By engaging with and interacting through Token Ibis, you can increase your ability to have a positive impact on the social issues you care about most, and empower others in your community to do the same. You can help, learn, and spread the word about the causes closest to your heart. You, and anyone else engaged on this platform, have the ability to knowledgeably choose where your money goes and what causes it supports, effectively democratizing social impact.

If you have made it to this part of the Welcome! email, congratulations! You are one tenacious and dedicated individual. Thank you so much for your interest and involvement in Token Ibis; with your help, we can make social change and impact through charitable giving more accessible to everyone.

*Though Token Ibis does enable you to deposit your own money in the app, you are unable to withdraw any money unless you are one of the registered nonprofits receiving a donation.
